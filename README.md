Description: This code represents a strategic, turn-based board game where two players, an Attacker and a Defender, face off in a manual, human vs. human mode. Each player has a set of unique units on a gridded board, and they take turns to move or command their units to perform actions, such as attacking or self-destructing. The game's complexity arises from the necessity to manage units strategically and anticipate the opponent's moves. A unit's self-destruct action has implications, affecting adjacent units. The game meticulously records each playerâ€™s moves and the evolving game state, concluding when a predefined condition is met, such as the self-destruction of a unit, declaring the opposing player the winner. The output of the game session can also be directed to a text file, providing a detailed log of the game's progress and final state.
